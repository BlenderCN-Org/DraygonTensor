         * @name Characteristic Data and State
         *
         * This data holds the state of the rigid body. There are two
         * sets of data: characteristics and state.
         *
         * Characteristics are properties of the rigid body
         * independent of its current kinematic situation. This
         * includes mass, moment of inertia and damping
         * properties. Two identical rigid bodys will have the same
         * values for their characteristics.
         *
         * State includes all the characteristics and also includes
         * the kinematic situation of the rigid body in the current
         * simulation. By setting the whole state data, a rigid body's
         * exact game state can be replicated. Note that state does
         * not include any forces applied to the body. Two identical
         * rigid bodies in the same simulation will not share the same
         * state values.
         *
         * The state values make up the smallest set of independent
         * data for the rigid body. Other state data is calculated
         * from their current values. When state data is changed the
         * dependent values need to be updated: this can be achieved
