* AI Explanation - The Plastics

** Affordance Implementation
- Implemented in Lua
- Global Lua table
  - Maps AffordanceName to list of entity-value key-value pairs.
- AI has needs it wants to satisfy
  - For example, if an NPC's thirst need is high, the NPC will query the global
    affordance table for entities that afford 'drinking'. The table will return
    a list of entity-value pairs, indicating which entities afford drinking and
    how much they afford drinking.
  - NPC will try to find the entity with the highest value for the affordance
    that is closest (affordance value is weighted by distance from the NPC).
- When an NPC has reached an object it would like to use to satisfy it's need,
  the NPC grabs the object's interactible component and passes it's own entity
  id to the interactible component's 'use' method.
  - function use(entity) { ... }
- The object's interactible component is responsible for telling the NPC how it
  should sit on the chair (interactible component set's the interacting entity's
  animation, position, transform parent, etc.)
- In the case of something like a chair, the interactible component is also
  responsible for telling the NPC if it can interact with it (e.g., a chair
  might already have someone sitting in it).

** Emotion
- We decided to base our emotional model for the NPCs in the world off Lovheim's
  Cube of Emotion [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lövheim_cube_of_emotion].
- The model will use three different chemical values (serotonin, dopamine and
  noradrenaline) to determine the emotions of an NPC (such as shame, contempt,
  distress) as well as their overall mood.
- In the system chemical values are a float value between 0 and 1 inclusive.
- We simply clasify a chemical value of less than 0.5 as low and a chemical
  value of greater than or equal to 0.5 as high.

*** Emotion
- We then use the following lookup table to determine the emotion the NPC is
  currently feeling: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lövheim_cube_of_emotion].

*** Mood
- In our system, mood is again a simple float value between 0 and 1 inclusive.
- 0 is considered a bad mood, 1 a good mood.
- The three chemical levels are combined into a general mood using the dot
  product:
  - Mood = (Dot({ 1, 1, 1 }, { SerotoninValue, NoradrenalineValue, DopamineValue
    }) / 3), where 3 is the max value that can be returned by the dot product
    (Dot({ 1, 1, 1 }, { 1, 1, 1 }))
- This process means that mood is an average of the current emotional level and
  so changes less often than the emotional levels (as is consistent with X's model).

*** Affecting emotion
- Unwieldy to manipulate chemical values directly (what do they mean?)
- Easier to choose points on the cube we want to move towards (it is clear that
  this corner of the cube represents the shame emotion for example { 0, 0, 0 })
- Feed one of these points into the emotion system, this becomes our desired
  emotion point.
- Desired emotion vector = desired emotion point - current point
- Feed this desired emotion vector into mood.
- We made the simplifying assumption that when you're in a good mood, both good
  and bad emotions affect you less, when you're in a bood mood though, good and
  bad emotions are amplified (justify this!)
- Emotion vector is scaled by mood:
  - Proportion of emotion vector to apply = 1 - Invert mood (1/moodValue)
  - Clamp proportion between 0.1 and 0.9 (so that an emotion vector always has
    at least some effect and not too much)
  - { SerotoninNew, NoradrenalineNew, DopamineNew } = { SerotononinOld,
    NoradrenalineOld, DopamineOld } + { Scaled Emotion Vector }
- We then recalculate mood as above (using dot product).

**** Events and roles
- An event's effect on an NPC depends on their role. In a soccer game, if a goal
  is scored, the attackers are happy, the defenders sad and the referee doesn't
  care too much emotionally.
- So role determines desired emotion.
- Event fed to Role -> desired emotion

** Traits and quirks

*** Traits
- Model traits using traits table (global Lua table)
- Pre-populated with a list of string-object pairs:
  - "traitName": {SerotoninAmplifier value, NoradrenalineAmplifier value,
    DopamineAmplifier value}
- Models a particular NPC's disposition towards certain emotions.
- NPC randomly gets assigned two or three traits.

*** Quirks
- Model quirks using quirk table:
  - "quirkName": { function(entity) }
  - Lua function, passed entityID as argument
- Each NPC randomly gets assigned one quirk.
- Quirk function is executed 'every so often'.
- e.g. "tripOver": { function(entity) { entity:addForce(head, {1, 0, 0}) } }
